My name is Sean Escriva, I'm a systems engineer.

My past work and experiences are easily found online, if you're
interested, or just feel free to [ask me](https://twitter.com/webframp). 
I've spent years building networks, managing data centers, building 
infrastructure and teaching DevOps.

I have a lot of history using [Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/), formerly worked with
the amazingly talented teams at [Heavy Water Software](http://hw-ops.com) and [Sensu](https://sensu.io/).

Most recently I'm a full time volunteer in NY, working on infrastructure 
and cloud related projects.

My limited spare time is filled with functional languages, python, mechanical keyboards,
occasional attempts at guitar and learning spoken languages.

#### Webframp? 
It started as a joke. My wife's side of the family didn't use the word
*fart* and instead used *framp*. I always found this hilarious so
made up webframp as a joke and a reminder to never take myself or
anything online too seriously.
