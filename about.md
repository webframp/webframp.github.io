My name is Sean Escriva, I'm a systems engineer.

My past work and experiences are easily found online, if you're
interested. I've spent years building networks, managing data centers
and building infrastructure. I'm a zealous
[Chef](http://www.getchef.com/chef/) convert and currently work with
the amazingly talented team at
[Heavy Water Software](http://hw-ops.com)

My limited spare time is filled with functional languages, python,
volunteering and occasional attempts at guitar and learning spoken
languages.

#### Webframp?
It started as a joke. My wife's side of the family didn't use the word
*fart* and instead used *framp*. I always found this hilarious so
made up webframp as a joke and a reminder to never take myself or
anything online too seriously.
